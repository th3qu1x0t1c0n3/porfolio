Since my high school, I have a tower at home that I assembled myself. During the computer science technique at Cégep André-Laurendeau, I learned several programming languages including C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, dart, HTML and CSS. I also learned to use different operating systems including Windows and Linux. I also learned to use different software like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, etc. I also learned to use different versioning tools like Git, GitLab and GitHub. I also learned to use different data storage methods like SQL and NoSQL databases.",
